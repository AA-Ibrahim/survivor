            <p>Crewmates must stay vigilant and vote the impostors out.
                Impostors need to "kill" all crewmates while avoiding being caught.</p>
                
    
            <h2>You are a CREWMATE.</h2>
            
            <p>Try to survive the night and avoid getting killed by the impostors. 
                Stay alert to everything happening around you. An impostor could kill you without you even realizing. </p>
    
            <h3>To win as a crewmate:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Vote out ALL impostors</li>
                <li>Collect corks scattered in these rooms: living room, kitchen, rec room, tv room, bathroom (upstairs), bathroom (basement)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting a cork and reporting it to Alaa or Mo gives you a clue on how an impostor could kill.</li>
                <li>See anything suspicious? Call a meeting. If you think you know who an impostor could be, 
                    call for an emergency meeting and everyone gathers for a discussion and vote.</li>
            </ul>
